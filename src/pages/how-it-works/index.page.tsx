                If all of the above conditions are met then a token model can be introduced. This prevents early

                CALC, short for calculated, was born from the UST collapse. The initial contributors to CALC learned
                some hard lessons about letting emotions come into play when making investment decisions as well as
                mismanaging risk.

                These lessons were so harsh that the initial contributors decided to build a tool that let others learn
